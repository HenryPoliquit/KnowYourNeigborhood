# Know Your Neighborhood

The front-end of the “Know your neighborhood” web application will be developed using React JavaScript, an open-source JavaScript library. React JS allows us to create websites with the use of components allowing the developers to create dynamic and responsive web pages that are able to interact with the different APISs used for the application. Axios will also be used together with React JS to use the Rest API that we created using Spring Boot.

The users will be able to login the “Know your neighborhood” web application using the custom login created using the Rest API in Spring Boot, or with the use of existing APIs such as Google, and Facebook login APIs. Application of web hooks is also applied so that users are able to message the developers of the website on the contact us page.
